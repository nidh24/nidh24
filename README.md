## Hi there 👋
👋 Hi, I'm a passionate Software Developer focused on **Backend development**. My main toolkit includes **Python** and its frameworks like **Flask**, **FastAPI**, and **Django**.

🚀 I love **automating** workflows, exploring the latest tech trends, and continuously learning. I've recently started diving into **Generative AI** and working on exciting new possibilities with AI-driven projects.

🌐 Occasionally, I also venture into the frontend world with **JavaScript** and **React** to build complete web solutions.

💡 Always curious, always coding. Let's build something cool together!
